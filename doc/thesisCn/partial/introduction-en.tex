The \emph{longest common subsequence} (LCS) problem applied many products and fields widely.  In multi-core platform, most studies focus on the wavefront parallelism. Motivated by the definition of recursion in LCS, Jiaoyun Yang introduced a new formula to exploit more cache performance.  Here, we use the similar idea to improve LCS with variable contraints, which refer in Iliopoulos' study.  For example, \emph{fixed gap LCS} (FGLCS) require the distance between two consecutive matches limited at most $k+1$.  It can be solved in $O(nm)$, which $n, \; m$ is the length of input strings.

In many kinds of contraint, this paper foucus on \emph{variable gap LCS} (VGLS). The VGLCS require the distance between two consecutive matched limited at most $G_i$, which $G_i$ is the value of the position $i$ in input array. For example, two protein sequences $A = \tt{RCLPCRR}$ and $B = \tt{RPPLCPLRC}$, and two gap functions $G_A = [2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 2]$ and $G_B = [2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 3]$. Figure ~\ref{fig:VGLCSex} presents an example to show that tow motifs $\tt{R..C..R}$ and $\tt{R..C..C}$.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the section 2, we present the parallel algorithm to solve VGLCS problem. In the section 3, we present a new algorithm, which parallel easily and time complexity $O(nm)$ better than previous study. In the section 4 to 5, we provide the optimized implementation and the result of experiments. The last section has a brief conclusion in this paper.
