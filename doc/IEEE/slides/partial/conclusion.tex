  \begin{itemize}
    \item The rightmost-pops encoding is easy to implement and runs in
      $O(n^2 s/p+n\;\max(\log n, s))$ with $p$ processors,
    \item Consequently we can solve VGLCS with the rightmost-pops
      encoding for blocked sparse table in $O(n^2/p+n\log n)$ time
      with $p$ processors.
    \item Our dynamic tree computation technique can answer
      incremental ranged maximum query in amortized $O(1)$ time.
    \item Asymtotically better solution is {\em not} necessarily the
      better solution in practice.
  \end{itemize}
