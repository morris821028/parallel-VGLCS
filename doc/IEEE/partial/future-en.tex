\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:Future}

Many studies focused on how to minimize the amount of computation in the
encoding process, such as changing the recursion definition formula.  We
can use the transformation of several register state instead of the
memory access.  These methods are used off-line encoding. In the case of
the maximum value of the suffix,  our approach still does not apply all
the transformation in registers.  If we can change the mathematical
definition to reduce memory access, the performance will be more
significantly improved.
