Our parallel VGLCS algorithm run in $\theta(n \log n)$ time, and we
use sparse table to solve incremental suffix maximum query(ISMQ)
problem.  We provide the amortized sparse table which supports
incremental range maximum query(IRMQ) problem.  Finally, we can use
them to solve VGLCS problem in $\theta(nm)$ time, and also use
$\theta(nm)$ time to solve variable range gapped LCS problem which is
hard than variable gapped LCS problem.

In the practice, we presented easy-to-implements data structure for
const-time IRMQ-retrieval and provide the extra dynamic programming to
reduce the computing boundary, compressed the space to reduce cache
miss, and the auxiliary prefix/suffix array to avoid building
cartesian trees. Finally, the CORMQ-opt run $2.35 \times$ faster than
the origin the algorithm in the parallel environment.

In the incremental range maximum/minimum query, we provide the
theoretical $\theta(n)$ - amortized $\theta(1)$ algorithm by
lexicographical order encoding.
