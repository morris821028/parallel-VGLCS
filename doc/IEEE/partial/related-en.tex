The {\em wavefront method} address this parallelization difficulty by
keeping the computation as wavefront.  However, the wavefront
computation is not cache-friendly, i.e., the wavefront algorithm cannot
effectively keep the required data in cache.  To address this cache
issue, Maleki et al.~\cite{Maleki2016EfficientPU} developed a technique
to exploit more parallelism in the dynamic programming, and we can use
this technique for the issue in our situation.

% still not clear about what you mean by rank convergence
