The longest common subsequence problem with variable gapped
constraints (VGLCS) is used in genes, molecular biology.  We can find
$O(nm)$ solution in the previous study, which use the efficient
incremental suffix maximum query (ISMQ). ISMQ supports append a value
to array and get the suffix maximum value in amortized $O(1)$
time.  However, we can parallel origin algorithm by wavefront method,
but not have better performance.  In this paper, our algorithm and
data structure offer efficient operations and better theoretical time
complexity.  The VGLCS problem can be solved in $O(nm / p + n \log
n)$, which $p$ is the number of processors.
